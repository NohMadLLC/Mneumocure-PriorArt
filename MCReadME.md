## Abstract

Mneumocure™ introduces a novel clinical architecture designed to collapse the recursive entropy loops sustaining tumor survival and immune escape. This system integrates genetic modulation, metabolic trap engineering, ferroptosis induction, and biophysical waveform override (PEMF and terahertz) to disrupt the information integrity of cancer at its memory core. This paper is publicly released into the Patent Commons to pre-register authorship, block privatization, and authorize nonprofit clinical validation.

## Patent Commons Declaration

This white paper constitutes a prior-art disclosure under the Patent Commons framework. All protocols, diagrams, and system architecture are:

- Legally protected from third-party patenting under 35 U.S.C. §102 and Berne Convention Article 15(1)
- Released for educational, academic, and nonprofit research use only
- Considered enforceable prior art effective August 2, 2025

Any patent filed after this disclosure date referencing the core mechanisms in Mneumocure™ is considered pre-invalidated and subject to legal challenge.

## Ethics Statement

Mneumocure™ is designed as a healing and liberation technology. It may not be used in:

- Human experimentation without full informed consent  
- Bioweapons research, military medicine, or covert bio-control programs  
- Commercial drug pipelines that remove public access or ethical transparency

Any institution or individual modifying this system must retain public traceability and cite the original source.

## CRITICAL WARNING: CLINICAL RISK & LIABILITY

**DEADLY IF MISUSED**  
This system references pharmacological and electromagnetic agents that can cause fatal outcomes if misapplied:

- **GPX4 inhibitors (e.g., RSL3)** may cause **irreversible hepatic necrosis** above 2mg/kg  
- **Ferroptosis inducers + ketogenic protocols** may result in **renal failure**  
- **PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields)** may trigger **seizure activity** in neurologically vulnerable populations

This protocol is **NOT approved for self-administration or public clinical use**. It is shared **under the Patent Commons framework** strictly for protected academic, clinical, and investigational development.

### LEGAL PATH TO TRIALS

To move forward ethically:
- Use the preloaded template in `/IRB_TEMPLATE/` to propose structured research  
- Secure **IRB (Institutional Review Board)** approval  
- Engage in **ethics-backed n=1 observational trials** only through licensed practitioners

All unauthorized use is in direct violation of:
- **35 U.S.C. §271 (U.S. patent misuse)**
- **Helsinki Declaration of Medical Ethics**
- **Patent Commons Disclosure Law**
